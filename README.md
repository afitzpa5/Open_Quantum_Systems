# Open_Quantum_Systems
Some notebooks of work carried out during my MSc as part of the open quantum systems course

Made obvious by the names of the notebooks, they deal with the following.
### Notebook 1
Dynamics of simple closed quantum systems, these include isolated qubits, driven qubits and groups of interacting qubits. All pure states.
### Notebook 2
Dynamics of mixed states including thermal states. Plus a look at some questions on probability distributions and quantum decoherence.
### Notebook 3
Mostly visualising various quantum states through their Husimi Q functions. These states were generated usually in the fock space representation using truncated hilbert spaces.
### Notebook 4
A look at the superoperator formalism of Open Quantum Systems. Also a look at the evolution of qubits in thermal baths and of time evolution of states undergoing spontaneous emission.
